# loading_bar 
tried creating a loading bar using python and i noticed that by printing inside the loop it keeps on showing eash increamental progress 
which wasnt what i want i dont want to see 10 lines of progress bar,
but printing outside the loop only deplays the final result because the loop completes before output
