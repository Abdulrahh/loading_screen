# loading_bar 
I tried creating a loading bar using Python, and I noticed that printing inside the loop shows each incremental update on a new line, which isn’t what I want. I don’t want to see multiple lines of the progress bar. However, when I print outside the loop, only the final result is displayed because the loop finishes before the output is shown
